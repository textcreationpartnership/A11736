         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE All, and every one of Us underwritten, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, that, after long and due Examination of our owne Conſciences, in matters of true &amp; falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, are now throughly reſolved of the Trueth, by the Word and Spirit of God, &amp; therefore we believe with our hearts, confeſſe with our mouths, ſubſcribe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:27090:3"/>with our hands, and conſtantly affirme before God, and the whole World: that this onely is the true Chriſtian Faith and Religion, pleaſing God, and bringing Salvation to man, which now is by the mercie of God revealed to the world, by the preaching of the bleſſed Evangell.</p>
            <p>And received, believed, and defended, by many and ſundry notable Kirkes and Realmes, but chieflie by the <hi>Kirk of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the Kings Majeſtie, and three eſtates of this Realme,</hi> as Gods eternall Trueth, and only ground of our Salvation: as more particularlie is expreſſed in the Confeſſion of our Faith, ſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and publicklie confirmed by ſundry Acts of Parliaments, and now of a long time hath beene openlie profeſſed by the Kings Majeſtie, and whole body of this Realme, both in Burgh and Land. To the which Confeſſion and forme of Religion, wee willinglie agree in our conſciences in all points, as unto Gods undoubted Trueth and Veritie, grounded onely upon his written Word. And therefore, we abhorre and deteſt all contrarie Religion, and Doctrine: But chieflie, all kinde of Papiſtrie, in generall and particular heads, even as they are now damned and confuted by the <hi>Word of God, and Kirk of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> but in ſpeciall wee deteſt and refuſe the uſurped au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of that Roman Antichriſt upon the Scriptures of God, upon the Kirk, the civill Magiſtrate, and conſciences of men. All his tyrannous lawes made upon indifferent things againſt our Chriſtian libertie. His erroneous Doctrine, againſt the ſufficiencie of the written Word, the perfection of the Law, the office of Chriſt, and his bleſſed Evangell. His corrupted Doctrine concerning originall ſinne, our naturall inabilitie and rebellion to Gods Law, our Iuſtification by faith only, our imperfect Sanctification and obedience to the Law, the nature, number and uſe of the Holy Sacraments. His five baſtard Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, with all his Rites, Ceremonies, and falſe Doctrine, added to the miniſtration of the true Sacraments without the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:27090:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>Word of God. His cruell judgement againſt Infants, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting without the Sacrament: his abſolute neceſſitie of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: his blaſphemous opinion of Tranſubſtantiation, or reall preſence of Chriſts body in the Elements, and receiving of the ſame by the wicked, or bodies of men. His diſpenſations with ſolemne Oathes, Perjuries, and degrees of Marriage forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the Word: his crueltie againſt the innocent divorced: his divelliſh Maſſe: his blaſphemous Prieſthood: his profane Sacrifice for the ſinnes of the dead and the quicke: his Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation of men, calling upon Angels or Saints departed, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Imagerie, Relicts, and Croſſes, dedicating of Kirks, Altars, Dayes, Vowes to creatures; his Purgatorie, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for the dead, praying, or ſpeaking in a ſtrange language, with his Proceſſions and blaſphemous Letanie, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Advocates or Mediators: his manifold Orders, Auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Confeſſion: his deſperate and uncertaine Repentance; his generall and doubtſome Faith; his ſatisfactions of men for their ſinnes: his Iuſtification by works, <hi>opus operatum,</hi> works of Supererogation, Merits, Pardons, Peregrinations, and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: his holy water, baptiſing of Bells, conjuring of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, croſſing, ſaning, anointing, conjuring, hallowing of Gods good creatures, with the ſuperſtitious opinion, joyned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: his wordlie Monarchie, and wicked Hierarchie: his three ſolemne vowes, with all his ſhavellings of ſundrie ſorts, his erroneous and bloudie decres made at <hi>Trent,</hi> with all the ſubſcribers and approvers of that cruell and bloudie Band, conjured againſt the Kirk of God: and finallie, wee deteſt all his vaine Allegories, Rites, Signes and Traditions, brought in the Kirk, without, or againſt the Word of God, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of this true reformed Kirk; to the which wee joyne our ſelves willinglie, in Doctrine, Faith, Religion, Diſcipline, and uſe of the Holy Sacraments, as lively members of the ſame, in Chriſt our Head: promiſing, and ſwearing by the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:27090:4"/>
               <hi>Great Name of the Lord our God,</hi> that wee ſhall continue in the obedience of the Doctrine and Diſcipline of this Kirk, and ſhall defend the ſame according to our Vocation and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, all the dayes of our lives, under the paines contained in the Law, and danger both of Body and Soule, in the day of Gods fearefull Iudgement: and ſeeing that many are ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up by Sathan, and that Roman Antichriſt, to promiſe, ſweare, ſubſcribe, and for a time uſe the holy Sacraments in the Kirk, deceitfullie, againſt their owne conſciences, mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby, firſt, under the externall cloake of Religion, to corrupt and ſubvert ſecretlie Gods true Religion within the Kirk, and afterward, when time may ſerve, to become open enemies and perſecutors of the ſame, under vaine hope of the Popes diſpenſation, deviſed againſt the Word of God, to his greater confuſion, and their double condemnation in the day of the LORD IESUS.</p>
            <p>Wee, therefore, willing to take away all ſuſpition of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, and of ſuch double dealing with God and his Kirk, Proteſt, and call <hi>The Searcher of all hearts</hi> for witneſſe, that Our mindes and hearts, doe fully agree with this our <hi>Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion Promiſe, Oath</hi> and <hi>Subſcription,</hi> ſo that Wee are not mooved for any wordly reſpect, but are perſwaded onely in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, through the knowledge and love of Gods true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, printed in Our hearts, by the holy Spirit, as wee ſhall anſweer to him in the day, when the ſecrets of all hearts ſhall bee diſcloſed. And becauſe wee perceave, that the quietnes and ſtabilitie of our Religion and Kirk, doth depend upon the ſaſetie and good behaviour of the Kings Majeſtie, as upon a comfortable inſtrument of Gods mercie; graunted to this Countrey, for the maintaining of his Kirk, and miniſtration of Iuſtice amongſt us, wee proteſt and promiſe with our hearts under the ſame Oath, Hand-writ, and paines, that wee ſhall defend his Perſon and Authoritie, with our goods, bodies,

And final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, being convinced in our mindes, and confeſſing with our mouthes, that the preſent and ſucceeding generations in this Land, are bound to keep the foreſaid nationall Oath and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription inviolable. Wee Noblemen, Barrons, Gentlemen,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:27090:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>Burgeſſes, Miniſters, and Commons under ſubſcribing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering divers times before, and eſpecially at this time, the danger of the true reformed Religion, of the Kings honour, and of the publick peace of the Kingdome: By the manifold innovations and evills generallie conteined and particularlie mentioned in our late ſupplications, complaints, and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations: Doe heereby profeſſe, and before <hi>God,</hi> his Angels, and the World ſolemnelie declare: That, with our whole hearts wee agree and reſolve all the dayes of our life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantlie to adhere unto, and to defend the foreſaid true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and (forbearing the practiſe of all novations, alreadie introduced in the matters of the worſhip of GOD, or apro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the corruptions of the publicke Governement of the Kirk or civill places and power of Kirkmen, till they be tryed and allowed in free aſſemblies, and in Parlaments) to labour by all meanes lawfull to recover the puritie and libertie of the Goſpell, as it was eſtabliſhed and profeſſed before the Foreſaid novations: and becauſe after due examination, wee plainelie perceave, and undoubtedlie believe, that the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations and evils conteined in our Supplications, Complaints, and Proteſtations have no warrant of the Word of <hi>God,</hi> are contrarie to the Articles of the Foreſaid Confeſſions to the intention and meaning of the bleſſed reformers of Religion in this Land, to the above writtin Acts of Parlament, and doe ſenſiblie tend to the re-eſtabliſhing of the Popiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and tyrannie, and to the ſubverſion and ruine of the true Reformed Religion, and of our Liberties, Lawes and Eſtates. Wee alſo declare, that the Foreſaid Confeſſions are to be interpreted and ought to be underſtood of the Foreſaid novations and evils no leſſe than if every one of them had beene expreſſed in the Foreſaid confeſſions, and that wee are obliged to deteſt and abhore them amongſt other particular heads of Papiſtrie abjured therein. And therefore from the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:27090:8"/>knowledge and conſciences of our duetie to <hi>God,</hi> to our King and Countrey, without any wordly reſpect or inducement, ſo farre as humane infirmitie will ſuffer, wiſhing a further meaſure of the grace of <hi>God</hi> for this effect. We promiſe, and ſweare by the <hi>Great Name of the Lord our GOD,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the Profeſſion and Obedience of the Foreſaid Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: That we ſhall defend the ſame, and reſiſt all theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie errours and corruptions, according to our vocation, and to the uttermoſt of that power that <hi>GOD</hi> hath put in our hands, all the dayes of our life: and in like manner with the ſame heart, wee declare before <hi>GOD</hi> and Men, That wee have no intention nor deſire to attempt any thing that may turne to the diſhonour of <hi>GOD,</hi> or to the diminution of the Kings greatneſſe and authoritie: But on the contrarie, wee promiſe and ſweare, that wee ſhall, to the uttermoſt of our power, with our meanes and lives, ſtand to the defence of our dread Soveraigne, the Kings Majeſtie, his Perſon, and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, in the defence and preſervation of the foreſaid true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Liberties and Lawes of the Kingdome: As alſo to the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall defence and aſſiſtance, every one of us of another in the ſame cauſe of maintaining the true Religion, and his Majeſties Authoritie, with our beſt counſell, our bodies, meanes, and whole power againſt all ſorts of perſons whatſoever. So that whatſoever ſhall be done to the leaſt of us for that cauſe, ſhall bee taken as done to us all in generall, and to every one of us in particular. And that wee ſhall neither directly nor indirectly ſuffer our ſelves to bee divided or withdrawn by whatſoever ſuggeſtion, allurement, or terrour from this bleſſed and loyall Conjunction, nor ſhall caſt in any let or impediment, that may ſtay or hinder any ſuch reſolution as by common conſent ſhall be found to conduce for ſo good ends. But on the contrarie, ſhall by all lawfull meanes labour to further and promove the ſame, and if any ſuch dangerous and diviſive motion be made
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:27090:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>to us by Word or Writ, We, and every one of us, ſhall either ſuppreſſe it, or if need bee ſhall incontinent make the ſame known, that it may be timeouſly obviated: neither do we fear the ſoule aſperſions of rebellion, combination, or what elſe our adverſaries from their craft and malice would put upon us, ſeeing what we doe is ſo well warranted, and ariſeth from an unfeined deſire to maintaine the true worſhip of God, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie of our King, and peace of the Kingdome, for the common happineſſe of our ſelves, and the poſteritie. And becauſe wee cannot look for a bleſſing from God upon our proceedings, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept with our Profeſſion and Subſcription wee joine ſuch a life and converſation, as beſeemeth Chriſtians, who have renewed their Covenant with God; Wee, therefore, faithfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, for our ſelves, our followers, and all other under us, both in publick, in our particular families, and perſonall carriage, to endevour to keepe our ſelves within the bounds of Chriſtian libertie, and to be good examples to others of all Godlineſſe, Soberneſſe, and Righteouſneſſe, and of every duetie we owe to God and Man, and that this our Union and Conjunction may be obſerved without violation, we call the living GOD, the Searcher of our Hearts, to witnes, who knoweth this to be our ſincere Deſire, and unfained Reſolution, as we ſhall anſwere to <hi>JESVS CHRIST,</hi> in the great day, and under the paine of Gods everlaſting wrath, and of infamie, and loſſe of all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reſpect in this World, Moſt humbly beſeeching the Lord, to ſtrengthen us by his holy Spirit for this end: and to bleſſe our deſires and proceedings with a happie ſucceſſe, that Religion and Righteouſneſſe may flouriſh in the Land, to the glory of <hi>GOD,</hi> the honour of our King, and peace and comfort of us all. In witneſſe whereof wee have ſubſcribed with our hands all the premiſſes, &amp;c.</p>
